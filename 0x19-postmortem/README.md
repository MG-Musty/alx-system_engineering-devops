# A POSTMORTEM OF MY PERSONAL PROJECT (QINGSPOET)

This project was a motivation from someone so special to me **QINGS**

**Qingspoet:** Is a true definition that gives overview expressions from the heart and soul, which defines us as humans. The creation of Man, Love, Emotions, Struggles, and Affections was something that makes us different from any other living things in the universe. This App was designed to help mankind to learn and to appreciate what love is.

Here at **Qingspoet** you are about to experience the true nature of human expressions and motivational quotes that will uplift the mind and growth. Man can't do it alone and so we all need words that can change our mindsets, words that can encourage us to strive. Motivational quotes are words that fill our souls with other sights to view all our difficulties in life and intertwine it to focus on life.
This is the reason why **Qingspoet** came into existence, to support and alleviate mankind to be hopeful in Love and growth. Stay with us as we give out new updates for both poets and motivational quotes to spicy up all of the emotional and life struggles. Also a section for a regular Blog Post.

# THE PROJECT START AND ENDS

The project commencement began on the 12-December-2022, after some brief project meeting despite it being a self test project and it ended finally on the 3rd-Jan-2023.
Starting the project required a lot of planning and organizing even if it was a self development project.

# CHALLENGES

On this part is the challenges or difficulty encounter during the project;

* Failure during installing some dependencies that required some updates to latest version

* Deciding on the best database storage

* Choose the right technologies for the project.

All of this came with serious issues that required to be fixed immediately before I was able to do any. But by searching and implementing the right technology I was able to resolve the complication.
How I managed to notice some of the issues was when during my run server at my local terminal I immediately realized the error messages. Some immediately google to check what it was, then I had to get all the dependencies and then resolve the problems.

At some point even uploading some CSS files was just total failure but as a software engineer I am trained to do  hard things, so the problem was found and debugged.

# DEPLOYMENT

The App runs locally on Apache web server, a web framework Django which is a python owned framework.

There were not many issues during deployment of the project on the web server locally, it was a smooth and successful running of the server on my local computer.
As mentioned earlier where I needed to upgrade some of the version of the dependence and give me a delivery at the of the project.

I believe that in future if such a project comes my way either in team or individual, it wonâ€™t be much of a challenge cause I already know what technologies and tools are suitable and reliable.
